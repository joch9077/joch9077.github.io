<h1>Limbus Company</h1>
<p> Limbus Company is an indie horror role-playing video game for Microsoft Windows and mobile devices using iOS or Android, developed and published by South Korean studio Project Moon.</p>
<h2>Plot</h2>
<p> Limbus Company opens with a person who has lost their memories and has a literal clock for a head being accosted by strong Fixers. This person is soon saved by Vergilius, a legendary Fixer known as the "Red Gaze," who informs them that their name is Dante, and that they are the new executive manager of Limbus Company. The company has tasked a special group of its employees known as Sinners with a mission to seek out Golden Boughs, sources of great power, that are scattered across The City in the ruins of the now-destroyed Lobotomy Corporation and its branch offices for an unexplained purpose. As they travel across The City in a customized bus named Mephistopheles (sometimes shortened to Mephi), Dante tries to piece back their identity, while the Sinners are forced to reckon with their own pasts as they seek out the Golden Boughs.</p>
